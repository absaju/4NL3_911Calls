We I have a bear mauling. I am out on the trail. I just reported it to somebody else who's going to be calling 911, I have a young girl here who is mauled by a bear and is in pretty bad shape. So we need paramedics.

Okay, I'm going to transfer you through to the medics. Or did you guys already talk to the medics? I have not talked to anybody yet. Okay, where are you guys?

Okay? To access us. Easiest access would be to go to the hilltop ski area and go down what is called the gas line trail to where it meets Campbell Creek.

There is a closest to hilltop, hilltop

ski area, yes,

into the actual ski area, there's a trail

you can hold on one second. Okay, now that I've got kind of where you are, I need to transfer you through to the medics. Okay, hold on. Thank you. So

reach our departments. Department, hello, Anchorage Fire Department, hello.

Can you still hear me? Yes, I can, okay, hold on one second and try to transfer. You again. Okay, fine.

I know you will be just

you just gotta wait.

You said you haven't Yes, hello, okay, hold on a second. Fire paramedics, what's the location of the emergency?

Okay, you want the location of the emergency? Yes, it is on what is called rovers Run Trail, and the best way to access that is by gas line Trail, which begins what's the problem? Tell me exactly what happened. Okay, I just came across a young girl who was mauled by a bear. She is, I'm

going to ask you some questions about her while my partner did help started. We do have calls on this. I just need to get some better patient information.

I believe she's about 1615, 1615, years old. All right,

confirming. Is she conscious? She is conscious. Is she breathing? She is breathing heavily? Yes. Just a couple more questions for her. While my partner gets up started, what does this? When did this happen? I would say within the last probably 15 to 20 minutes. Probably be accurate. Is there any serious bleeding? Yeah, severe bleeding. All right. Are you with her right now? I am, and we're in close proximity to where it happens. What kind of injuries does she have? It's hard to tell if it's dark enough and I dropped my bike. All right, down the trail. I don't have a light. All right. Is there any animal? Is the attacker? Is the Animal Center by,

not that I know of. I hope it's gone away, but all

right, how far are you in from Campbell airstrip Road, okay.

Campbell airstrip Road, strip road, you would if you came up Campbell airstrip road, you would access us by the South give Black trailhead, Trailhead one more time. Okay, the South give Black

trailhead,

and you have to go down the trail to Campbell Creek. And from the opposite side of Campbell Creek, there's a trail called rovers run that parallels the creek. There's a there's a small foot bridge, and there's a main bridge just up from there, sir, listen, we understand that we got somebody at the trailhead. What are we need to know about? How far in are you about? Okay, what Trailhead are you at? We're gonna come in off the south bick trailhead, just like you said, Okay, our first caller gave us that information, waiting up there for us. Okay, okay, don't go in the trail head, and there will be, if you are you guys gonna drive a vehicle in? I don't know if they're gonna be able to drive a vehicle in or not. I'm not out there, sir. Okay, but okay, if you go in the trailhead, I would say about 100 yards down the trail, there is a left there's a right hand turn and it goes down a steep dirt trail, down a steep dirt trail, which then takes you right to Campbell Creek. There's a foot bridge that crosses Campbell Creek. Okay, go across the foot bridge, and we are on a trail that parallels the creek on the opposite and you have to go across the foot. Bridge. You turn to the right, just walk down at about 100 yards. You'll see two bikes on the trail, and we're just a little ways down from that. Okay, you have somebody out there. Yeah, we're gonna keep you on the phone, because there's supposedly somebody out there at the road. Just gonna direct us down there, but we're gonna get this information on doing good. Patreon, you're doing awesome. You're just fine. Really, fine. It's scary, but that's all it is. Okay. All right. Does she have any serious bleeding? Yes, okay. What I want you to do is get a clean, dry cloth or towel, place it on the wound, press it down firmly, and do not lift it up to look. I don't know exactly where the wound is. Is the problem? All right, can you ask her where she thinks she's hurt? You know where your hurts are at? Listen, yeah, I got a quick question. How close are you to the camel airstrip, to the Campbell airstrip? We are. We're much farther than the actual airstrip. I understand. Okay, very good. So if we're up at, or if we're on the engine company that's out there right now, they're at the access to the camel airstrip. Okay? They want, they want to go up. They need to go further up the road. They need to go farther up the road there. There's a trailhead on either side of the road. They're right next to each other. One is North Trailhead. It goes towards, okay, so they need to go farther up the road. How far up the road from the access to the camel airstrip? I would say a mile and a half, two miles, something like that. There will be two very obvious trailheads with big wooden signs, okay, so the so it's marked, yeah, north and south, yeah, and they want to go in the South. Good Trailhead.

Okay, so once they get,

so once they get to the south bivouac parking lot, they're going to go down the trail, and they're going to go take a they're going to go down the trail about 50 or 100 yards, okay, they're going to look to their right. There's a steep dirt trail that you can walk down. Okay, walk down that towards the creek, which we'll see, there's a footprint that crosses the creek, and you cross the creek, and then you immediately take a right onto a very obvious trail, and they should probably have a gun or bear protection. We're getting the cops to come out there with us. So okay, doing good. Pedro, keep it up, doing great, but you're okay,

they're still with me. Okay, yeah, I'm

talking to the girl here.

There was, there is a bear there. Not that I know of, but you know, there's water, yes, I hear, you know, kind of bear with? I don't know. Hey, Joe, you're doing so good. You're doing awesome. Just Just relax.

Just relax. Okay, I just, I want you to stay awake. Is

she? Is? She breathing regularly? Yeah, but, but I would, I would say, heavy breathing. She's, she's very much conscious.

But, you know,

going good.

Doing good, doing good. Do you know where you

I'm sorry, go ahead. Can you hear anybody out there? No, you know. Is there some good chance that someone will be through any time now, because there's a there's a bike race, a 24 hour race going on, and bikers will be coming through,

but, but if there's a

fight with you, see somebody pass by, I want you to stop them, and

I'll have them go up and flag, yeah, yeah. The light is on on my bike. If they look down, once they kind of make the turn into the trail, they'll kind of see, hey, can you stop please? Who is

that? Okay? We have,

she was attacked by bear.

We have the paramedics coming, but this is the issue. They're going to be coming into the south of black Trailhead. Can you go up there and direct them down? I want you to yell and be as careful as you can, because the bears obviously still the proximity. Okay, okay, just make a lot of noise. Are you doing awesome? You're doing so good.

Still there. Do not okay, okay, awesome.

Are you guys still there? We're still here. Okay?

We're letting them know right now that we're sending that you're sending somebody down. He's going

to go right up to the south blue box trailhead, and he'll direct them down. It's a little bit of a hike down, but it's not, it's not that big of a deal. How's she doing? She seems doing extremely well. It's, you know, she's still, she's still conscious. She's she can move a little bit

where the bleeding is coming from.

You don't know where you got hurt. Okay, no, just, yeah, it's crazy, but I just can't tell. It looks like she might have got rolled around in the dirt quite a bit by the bear

here, Pedro, hold my hand. Okay,

you're doing awesome. I'm gonna be fine. If you just hang in there couple minutes, you'll be getting cleaned up. It's doing way better. You go.

Got it, you're doing good.

Tell me if you tell me if you start to hurt more, something happens. Okay. Can you see, are you looking ahead? Okay, okay,

just keep relaxing. We don't

want her to move around unless she's in danger. Okay, okay, splint any injuries. Yeah,

I, I moved her. I moved up to about 50 feet from where the attack was because I just, yeah, I figured that was probably constituted as danger. But, you know, I don't know. Oh, don't move if you don't have to, please. Okay, Pedro,

doing off. Doing so good.

I think someone's, someone's going to be here any minute now.

Doing great. Do we? Do we have any word on

this based on the trail, yet? They're

on location. They're responding on location right now. They're looking for the trail, okay?

And we've got that other biker going up there, so that'll be good. Yeah.

Hey, drew you doing awesome. We'll all be over pretty soon.

This is APD about how many miles up Campbell airstrip road as the trailhead, if

they were at the Campbell airstrip trailhead, I would say, I would say, I don't have to choose else, but I don't entirely know, not very up if they start going up the scoop caves climb, if they start going Up the hill, and it's like a big up, then they've gone past it, a big what if they start going, like really way up in an extended climb, if it starts to really climb uphill and gone past it, we've got another ice coming. Hey, can you stop? Is

that another biker? Yeah. Can you come here, please?

Who is that? Okay, can you hang with me? Yeah, okay,

we have, we have a bear attack.

So maybe if you can just hang out here, I sent will up the up to the south mid wax, right. Okay, you're okay. Pedia, okay, so help, help me. Flag people into here. That's good. That's our main concern. Hello. Okay, it sounds like they might be coming. I'm not sure, but you see coming. The paramedics coming. Okay, okay, sounds like they're on there talking to a couple other bikers just showed up. Okay, so we don't know where the bleeding coming from. We're just gonna hold her in place.

Who are the two bikers talking to? Though, that came up

is that the paramedics that are on location right

now? Yeah, we have, EMT

here right now. There's an anchorage Fire Department. EMT, are you fire department? No, okay, so when they said they have paramedics, they met the paramedics. There's somebody there at the trailhead. Can they confirm that to somebody who's up at the trailhead to meet us? I can't confirm that. Well, we're concerned about, okay, hold on, just a moment here. I'm sorry, or the trailer you're on, this is what I need to know. The trail Huron is not accessible by a vehicle. Is that correct or not? Yes, that is correct. Don't need a board. It's a foot trail home. Yes, that's correct. So they need to come down the south bivouac, go across the foot bridge and then take a right and go down the trail that parallels Campbell Creek. Yep, yeah,

rover trail, yes.

Run rover trail. And there, there's a there's a gentleman that's up there to kind of flag him in. Okay, well, I'm thinking that he already met them. They should be on their way in there. Shortly, okay, okay, good. We're gonna keep you on the phone until, till they Yeah,

we do have an EMT on the scene, so

we've got a couple people here now. So,

Adrian, doing awesome. Doing good.

We'll be all over soon.

How she doing? She's doing great. She's her breathing, her breathing slowed down a little bit. Just because she's calming down,

you still have a clean, dry cloth. Can

you still, can you find out where the bleeding is from now, I mean, since she's calmed down a little bit, can you ask her what she means? She got bit she I've asked her three times. She still doesn't know. We have an empty and he is, he's starting to kind of take off some clothing and do searching. So, all

right, well, let me just say, find anything. Just let me know. Okay,

looks like it may just, just looking. It looks like a puncture wound to the face, and I think that may be where a lot of the blood is from a little bit of left eye trauma. It looks like a puncture wound or a little trauma to the inner thigh, but it's not bleeding. It doesn't look like, it like hit an artery or anything. Important thing is that we need to keep her as still as possible. We don't are moving around unless she is in danger, okay, yeah, we're not sure what type of other injury she has suffered when she was attacked, right? I understand. I understand. We're not moving here. We can try to keep that still as possible.

You're doing great. This

is APD. Do you know what type

of error it is? Do I know No, we sold.

You know, it's dark, so I seriously doubt that, doubt that she was able to identify what that spirit was okay,

because you're doing so good. Just relax.

You're in good hands. I

The medics

have met somebody on top of the road, and they're on their way down.

Okay, okay, Pedro, the medics have met Will up at the top of the road. They're gonna be down here. Okay, I mentioned that for the medic, it's just APD or the medic, both of us are on the phone. Oh, okay, okay. And I think I mentioned that there is a puncture wound to the inner thigh,

and also one kind of on the quadriceps,

like above the knee. It looks like kind of a similar wound. I

people, you're doing awesome. Let

me know when you see them. Okay.

And then will I give them? Will that? Will I ask them? Or should I get the phone to a medic? If they know they'll be able to help her. Okay, okay, once they're on location with her, just let me know, and then I'll hang up with you. You're doing a good job. Starting to have a little trouble breathing because she's in pain, or, I think there may she's got a lot of pressure right on my leg there. I just, I wonder if that's gonna hurt her ribs. Same position. Movement keeper, same position that she's in. Okay, we had to move her on her side. She or she kind of has rolled over on her side. There seems to be a little bit of a puncture. We're maybe in the in the throat area. You. I think she's starting to struggle to breathe a little bit at the moment. All right, let me know if anything changes with her. Okay, she she's breathing

more rapidly,

as we're doing. Sure, though we have help on the way for her and that the medics are coming. Okay, Joe, I know it hurts, just relax. Genetics are on their way. You're, they're going to be here in just a second and just relax.

Okay, she's, I think I'm okay. All right, you

and Sir, we've got officers escorting the medics in right now. Okay,

okay, we have some police coming in with the medics because they're concerned about the bearing area. Can I get your name, sir, my name is Pete passinger,

thank you. We also just located

a kind of a wound.

Located wound, kind of a rather large, I would say, probably three inches long.

I'm just confirming that the people that are helping her, they have a clean, dry cloth on these wounds, eye pressure, and I'm not lifting it up to look well. The

wound pain, the wounds, they don't seem to be bleeding. That bad facial wound that seems to be bleeding, okay, but, but just to let you know, there is a wound in her back, kind of above her left butt cheek. It's probably about three inches long, you know, kind of into the knee area. It's not bleeding that bad, but it is, you know, a little bit

dirty. So okay,

you're an awesome patron. Just keep them action. We're gonna get you all fixed up here. Okay, medics, the medics have arrived. We have Okay, excuse me. Is that the ASD medics, we have, yeah, we have a fire department medic. And are the police with us too? Yeah, the police are here with guns and everything. I'm gonna let you go so you can talk to them. Thank you for calling for okay. Okay, thanks. Bye.",Paramedics

never seen a dead person outside of a coffin.

it's like an overhang thing that comes over and there's water running underneath, and it sounds like it just came, you know, like, slam right on top of them. I don't know. I can't hear them. There's too much noise of all the water running. Can't hear anything.

Okay, so

there are some, there's a lady that came. We are you guys from another organization. Okay, there's a, there's a leader here, that woman that's up here all the time, she's brought in there to set the situation. Okay,

so I want to make sure that if anybody else goes in there, though, that it's, I don't want anybody else actually go towards the cave, because I don't want it to collapse on anybody else.

I don't know if they're going inside. Nobody else goes in there. Nobody else is going in there. You're trying to go around it. You know, on the side of it,

that's my phone. Okay, so it sounds like part of the inside

this is a lady, still, we just have to talk to the lady. She has to stay on their phone.

Okay, Johnny, okay, I'm sorry about that. Is that correct? Yeah, I collapsed partly into the cave.

You can get a hold of Ryan. How far deep into the cave was it before it collapsed? How deep is it across? I would say probably maybe at 20 yards across, 20 by 20. Okay, so the cave is 20 by 20, yeah, so 20 by 20, okay. How far deep was the collapse in

it, though? I mean, was it COVID into it or no?

No, no. There's probably a 10 and 10 yards or seven yards into that where they walked in. Okay.

Okay, okay. Can

you confirm, do you know the phone number, Johnny phone number, by chance,

I can give you her phone number off of my phone. How about the specific cell doing her cell phone number, yeah. Joanie,

yes, what is your phone

number? Joni,

okay, go ahead and give your phone back to Chrissy, okay, just do what you can and say, Come Hey Chrissy.

Brian. Okay, so anyway, on, we're at this waterfall. Okay, so I'm going to talk to Brian. Let me come to Brian. Okay, Brian, so we're at this, like, this ice near the top of the falls, and Alex's olive you want to go in and so they can bring about seven yards. And then, you know, just exploring. And then we hear this fall that you gave us correct for and where, if it falls, the fall.

So this is Joni again, okay? Joni, are you okay? I mean, I know you're I know you're upset that. I just want to make sure you're okay right now I am. And is anybody else right there with you guys injured? I'm sorry, you guys right now, not in the case outside, injured, nobody else.

Some people that know, nobody else has been, some people that came along, there's like three people that are in there trying to rescue

if we can. I want to make sure, though, that whoever is in the cave is safe. I don't want anybody else. Okay,

well, this one woman that went in, I guess, is up here in high town all the time, and I guess she really knows what to do. We don't know the cave is stable. That makes sense. Yeah, it's already collapsed once, and so I

can't,

okay,

search and rescue that's been started

Now, if this is joking up, but I just walked inside the bank, and there's some lady with a rifle bringing the people inside, the inside the vault, and I just walked in and she goes, Oh, you better turn around and get out. And that's right around the left I'm standing in the parking lot right now.

been a couple hours, a couple hours.

Yes, it's been a long time.

Another carrier.

He got stuff in some water, so he went over there and got him and also come back to the house, and then everyone's like, what happened to D and D nobody. They wanted to talk to him all night. And they got two phones. He had one in this Fauci and she had a two way, two different types of phones. And so we decided to go look for him. I was taking him back to house to get another car. We went down lake shore, and that's what we found. When you turn left, there ain't no boxes, ain't no customers being done. You turn right, and there it's a dead end road. I mean, you go down there, and you follow their path that they would pay, and it leads you to that hole.

Yeah, well, actually, we would like to go back down and suggest flashlights and get there, down there. But okay, I don't want you to go back down there if there's a lot of flooding and things like that. I don't want you to look. No, no if you, if you can go right to the hole and look, there ain't no flooding, no water on the road, just had washed it out, but it's pitch black. You can't see nothing. And like me and Michael sent me, and there was a there's a tree laying on the other side. And we're wondering if they drove up to the tree stop and they did the world class. Okay, so there. So the water, the roadway has just been like washed out. That's why we're wondering, wash up the dirt from under the concrete. They stopped to the tree and fell in.

Okay, does

that make sense to you?

So you think the rose washed out and that they went down there. Say that again, there's a tree that fell right on the other side. We're thinking they rolled up to the tree and stopped, and when they did, you know, because the dirt was from under the road, because the concrete would just stay in most of the time, so they sat on it, and then they just fell in. Okay? I It ain't no safe to go down. I mean, there ain't no water around that. You can hear it rushing like a river down there in zaneville. Okay,

so you're gonna go to Lakeshore, M, 89 and weigh down

your thing. Larry,

well, how long did it take to get to 34 shell, M, 89 and blue star. I'm gonna try and give you some of your food as I can. Sir, how long?

I'd rather you wait at the 79 child there for an officer. Well, if you're gonna take 1015, minutes, they're down here freaking drowning or something.

One second. Okay, don't hang up.

Who you talking to.

Don't, don't. Don't tell her to stay home, though. Don't need her getting out here in the water too,

being flooded everywhere. You know, hey,

Fauci nothing's nothing. We think Dean and Dean went down lake shore and the road fell. And we think they fell into this thing down there. He called 911, they're dragging ass about getting somebody out here. They ain't got no other place down lake shore. We need to light man, yes, the road is flat gone the new places we brought up to that, to that spot, there's a tree right on the other side, like maybe they stopped and the road gave out from under them. They ain't got no boxes past that to him, and we cannot find that they broke down and tore up or anything. They had two phones on them being had a different type of branch, like a container on his pocket and gene we can't get over either one of them. Rachel man, you take them 89 down to, you know what? Grade four there. You head south on raid four, and when you get married. Yeah. Okay, so you have two of the of your mail carriers that are there out this morning. They're delivering the newspapers the Grand Rapids. President, no police officer, yes, I am at the show. They were. They were delivering newspapers, Sunday newspapers. They have two phones on Dean has a continual in his pocket. Jean had her all cells, okay, an autosomal connect cell. So they had two different types of phones and fully charged phones. Okay, other than not being able to get a hold of them on their phone, there's no other reason for you to think that something that dad happened to them. Correct? No,

yes, that

the um, the um

newspapers past that point. Larry, listen to me a second. All right, the roads are really bad. I'm good. They delivered newspapers. You can watch the mailboxes all the way today, okay, but the road was washed out there. Correct? Yeah. So they couldn't go past that point, right? No. So they want to be able to deliver newspapers past that point if there's no water there, correct? Listen, no, I get what you're getting at. But the road dead in. They would turn what right after that flood, they would do one more box the road would get in, and they would turn around, come back down, make sure, pass up the Midianite and start again, so you don't see where the vehicle had gone off the road or anything like that, right? No. Okay, where are you waiting right now? Well, y'all are taking forever, so we're gonna get 218, 17. Lakeshore. 28172817, Lakeshore, okay, we're during the bus that we can.

256.txt,"She has been missing since seven o'clock this morning, and her husband and her are in the middle of a divorce, and I'm not sure what the protocol would be, but I she supposedly went out for a run this morning at seven o'clock in rock mirror, and no one has heard from her. She was supposed to be in my house at eight, just because of the situation with the divorce. I just was wondering if you can help. I don't know what I should do. I just called rake Ned, and she has not been admitted on any emergent basis. So I was just wondering if anything, if someone can tell me if anything might have I don't an accident, or if you have any recommendations for me as how to proceed here. Okay, just

a moment. Place you on hold for just a moment. Thank you.

That's correct. All right. And what is your friend's name? Her name is Nancy Cooper. What is her address? Husband and her are living together, but they are in the middle of a divorce, and he is

okay. Cooper, hold on, one

second, no problem.

Do all right, and you tried making contact with her as well. So okay, the situation is as follows. She

according to her husband, when I called this morning at about nine that he said that she had left this morning for a run early, he believed, with her friend Carrie and normal but apparently she's still not returned, and the situation is just a little bit she should have been here. She was expected here, no later than not empirical, because she's also now having the same thought that I am about her husband, maybe that he's done something, and I don't, I mean, God forbid, but

has he been violent with her in the past? Well, we

I don't he's definitely been,

I don't know that he's been physically violent, but I know there's been a lot of tension, and so I wouldn't be surprised. I hate to say it, but I

just I'm not sure what to do. Okay,

is it possible that she might have done something else and possibly forgotten? Oh,

yeah. I mean, of course. But the thing that's strange is that her car is parked in the driveway at home, and her cell phone is there and looking as if, if she did, in fact, leave the house for a run this morning, she may well have done so, you know, on her own. So, of course, there may be a risk that something happened. I mean, she is a runner, and so legitimately, you know, she's been training for a half marathon, that something could have gone wrong. I thought maybe if She hurt herself,

she was supposed to be running with somebody else? Well, this is what her husband

said. I did not. Was not aware of her running with any friend this morning. But it doesn't really make any sense. She definitely has had. She had two schedules. She would have made contact with either me or her other friends by now who both had expected her today, and the fact that her car is still at home and her cell phone in there is a little weird. She you know that that's that would not make sense. So as of right now, I think basically, the information we have is that she left the house at seven o'clock, assuming her husband's telling the truth and she's not returned, which wouldn't make sense. So like, a two hour run might have been, you know, within reason, but that would have meant that she would have been definitely home by now. So what can the carried Police Department do to help us in this situation? How do we approach like at what point? What number of hours. Does her husband have to be the one to file? Like, what's the what's the procedure here?

At the moment here? Okay, ma'am, this is what we can do. We will have an officer go by and the address, okay, and speak with her husband and check on, okay, on the house. Okay.

Tall and slender, very pretty, blonde, brown hair.

What? There is no time limit as far as following the missing person report, but the person who last seen her right is the person that's kind of following the report. So it sounds like if she was last seen by her husband at seven o'clock, he would be the one responsible with filing the police report. Okay? Okay. So what we'll do, he's going to react to this either i Well, you know what it's It's okay. It's better to be safe than okay, then sorry. And you know, I mean, if you're concerned about or, yeah, this is what it you know what I would want my true friend to do exactly. So he did just call me directly to try an engineer.

I'm sorry, just be patient, but yeah, no, it's fine.

Or they I'm going to send somebody out there and stick with their husband and check the residence. Do you know around lockme or lake, or is there a trail around. Yeah, that's the thing

about what run. But I'm pretty confident that any of the trails that she would take, I mean, I've run them with her before. You know, they come in and off of rock Mayor drive, which means it's a pretty public I guess it is possible that someone, you know, maybe I'll go, just start running the trails, because, you know, there are some that are further off the beaten path, but yeah,

let let me go, let me do the couple things that we're going to do, and give me about 30, you know, 45 minutes to work with this, and then call me back. Okay. My name is Michelle. Thank you. Michelle. Okay, okay. Bye. Bye. You.",Law_Enforcement

There was a male and there was a shorter, fat woman.

Okay, now the woman, what did she look like? Was she a Hispanic female? She was a white she was white woman, okay, what other guns here that they fucking left?

Okay, don't touch that. Okay, none of them. No, you're fine.

You're fine. Don't worry. It's fine. Don't worry about your cussing. Can you remember the clothing that the female was wearing? And um, in camo, like

green camouflage, I couldn't tell.

And the guy is, like, super tall,

and the male, was he also white, yes,

okay. And then a Mexican came in. So

there was a white male, white female, and a Mexican male, and was he tall, or was he like, average? No, he was like, almost sick. Some day he was tall. Also they shot me, and I pretended like I was dead, and my daughter was crying. When they shot her, they shot

her again after the first time.

of dogs, but I think they went out when the door opened.

Are they just looking for money? What were they? I couldn't tell they just said, Hurry up and get what we need. But, I mean, we don't have drugs or anything like that in this house.

And the gun that they said they left behind is that a handgun,

that gun that they left behind, that handgun, right? It

looks like the thought of shotgun or something.

And you didn't touch it, right? No,

ma'am, don't, don't touch it. Sometimes I thought they had left, and I think she came back because they forgot the gun. And I jumped up to, okay, my husband's always had a gun in the house just in case, and that's good that you knew how to use it. Where you said you did you hit any of them or any of them. Who did you know? Oh, ma'am. Was that you shooting that I heard also. Oh, he was shooting. He was shooting at you, and

you don't think you hit any of them. No, okay.

Did you shoot off any rounds from your gun? Yes, okay. Oh, my God. Now,

how many shots do you think you shot off? I don't know, whatever you are, okay. So is that you only you shooting, or did they shoot two? No, they were shooting too, okay.

Oh, my God,

okay. And now, did you hear any vehicle speed off after they left? Left? This last time, I just heard some door shut. You heard door shut, but that was it. Okay. I They should be in the area. I think what they're doing right now is just checking the area, but where I'm trying to convince them to get someone to you. Okay, so they should, there should be, there's multiple units hanging there. They have, like, the whole army coming towards you. Okay, lay down, ma'am, that's fine. Lay down, but take the phone with you. Okay, keep me on the line so you can keep me updated on how you're doing. Is your daughter still crying? No, she's I think she's gone now, okay, and you're not expecting anybody, right? No family members are coming to visit anything like

that. Regardless, it, and

does it sound like they have any accents of any kind? Were they speaking like normal English, like you and me speaking English to us, and we were asking, what's going on, and they were telling us, you don't have the right to ask any questions right now. We need to check your house or this, this, this and this. And my husband's like, Why do you have tape on your gun? And that's why they shot him. Okay, they told did they? Did you notice they took anything? Yeah, okay, no, no. I mean before, when they first came in, no, okay. How are you doing? Are you holding up? Okay, I understand what you went. Just went through, but I don't. I don't mean to ask that in that sense. But is your leg? Are you okay? Okay? So the male shot your husband? Yes, okay. Was it the white male or the Hispanic male? So was there another one besides the three subject suspects that you told me about? No. Hold on, there was a lot of them, but the ones you saw there was the white, the Hispanic and the female. Okay, I need you. I need you to think. I need you to help just kind of focus on what I'm saying to you and trying to answer the questions. I know your leg hurts, I understand that your families were shot, but I need you to answer these questions so we can help catch these people. Okay, I just need you to think, just to keep your mind off of what's going on. Okay,

if you had to estimate, how many people would you say,

or four or five? Were they male and then that one female? Yeah. Okay. Do were they all wearing camel camouflage?

Only saw the three okay,

and you're in the kitchen. Okay?

And you can't think of any any one that would want to hurt you or your family.

You can you do me a favor about that? Can you call my mom and dad? Yeah, what room is your husband and your daughter in there in the kitchen, also you're in the living room now.

They're in the area. They're they're right there. I'm really afraid that some people are

gonna come back? Yeah,

they should, I mean, they should be right there, because they're asking me where you are and where your husband and your daughter are. So tell them, it's safe to come and buy and nobody's in here. Okay. Yeah, so you heard me yelling at them, right? Yeah, I heard, I heard a couple shots, and then I heard you yelling, saying, You said, get out, or I'm going to shoot you kind of thing. And then I heard more shots. Is that going to be held against me? No, this is self defense. You're you're going through a traumatic event, dude, I wouldn't expect anything less. And it's good that you got it on tape. I mean everything, it's because you're telling them, you're telling them to get out. And this was after shots were fired. And then I don't know if you shot first, I don't know what happened, but everything was on everything that I could hear is on the recording.

I'm sorry this is taking so long. I'm sure it seems like a lifetime.

Can you remember anything about the people that you saw that would make them stand out. She was really short and fat, and he was really super tall and was a big guy. Were they wearing any masks? Anything? His face is painted black, the white guy? Was he

the only one that had the painted face,

like the female that you saw on the other male that you saw, they didn't have black faces. Okay, I only saw the lady. I didn't see the other person that came in. Okay, so the female face wasn't painted black. Could you tell what color hair she had? Did she have a hat on? Okay? No, I understand. I'm just, I'm just asking you questions, my God,

and I'm so sorry for that.

Nobody ever has a reason for these things. One, so like, I've never heard of any of this stuff happening in a vodka. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely new to me. I haven't, haven't heard of anything like this either, unless they stole my vehicles outside as well. This is the up

No, I think she's gone now, okay, and
you're not expecting anybody, right? No family members are coming to visit anything like that. Okay? Particular and does it sound like they have any accents of any kind? Were they speaking like normal English, like you and me speaking
English to us, and we were asking what's going on, and they were telling us, you don't have the right to ask any questions right now. We need to check your house or this, my husband's like, Why do you have tape on your gun? And that's why they shot him. Okay?
They told did they? Did you notice they took anything?

Just went through, but I don't, I don't mean to ask that in that sense. But is your leg? Your your? Okay, okay. So the male shot your husband? Yes, okay. Was it the light mail or the Hispanic male? So was there another one besides the three subject suspects that you told me about? I. Hold on, there was a lot of them, but the ones you saw there was the white, the Hispanic and the female, okay, I need you to I need you to think. I need you to help just kind of focus on what I'm saying to you and try and answer the questions. I know your leg hurts, I understand that your families were shot, but I need you to answer these questions so we can help catch these people. Okay. I just need you to think, just to keep your mind off of what's going on. Okay,
if you had to estimate, how many people would you say,
or four or five? Were they male and then that one female? Yeah. Okay.
Were they all wearing camel camouflage?
Only saw the three okay,
and you're in the kitchen. Okay?
And you can't think of any any one that would want to hurt you or your family.

You can you do me a favor about that? Can you call
my mom and dad? Yeah,

I'm really afraid that when people are gonna come back. Yeah, they should. I mean, they should be right there, because they're asking me where you are and where your husband and your daughter are. So
tell them that they come inside and nobody's been here. Yeah.
So you heard me yelling at them, right? Yeah, I heard, I heard a couple shots, and then I heard you yelling, saying, You said, get out, or I'm going to shoot you kind of thing. And then I heard more shots. Is that going to be held against me? No, this is self defense. You're you're going through a traumatic event, dude, I wouldn't expect anything less, and it's good that you got it on tape. I mean, everything, it's because you're telling them, you're telling them to get out. And this was after shots were fired. And then I don't know if you shot first, I don't know what happened, but everything was on everything that I could hear is on the recording.
I'm sorry this is taking so long. I'm sure it seems like a lifetime.
Can you remember anything about the people that you saw that would make them stand out?
She was really short and fair, and he was really super tall and was a big guy. Were they wearing
any masks? Anything black,
the white guy? And was he
the only one that had the painted face,
like the female that you saw on the other male that you saw, they didn't have black faces. Okay? I only saw the lady. I didn't see the other person that came in. Okay, so the female face wasn't painted black. Could you tell what color hair she had? Did she have a hat on? Okay, no, I understand. I'm just, I'm just asking you questions. Oh, my God.
And I'm so sorry for this.
Nobody ever has a reason for these things.
Like, I've never heard of any of this stuff happening in Arabica. Yeah,
yeah. It's definitely new to me. I haven't, haven't heard of anything like this either.
They stole my vehicles outside as well.
And can you tell me the best way to get to your house?
Just go down the street, road where the community centers come
all the way down, all the way down to the end, all the way southbound. I don't know. Ma'am, I don't know. Okay. Are you right there? The corner. Okay. Do
you have a fence around your property at
all? Oh, yeah, my lights are all on, though. Okay, so the fence is it just your front yard or the backyard? No, this is so good, okay,
and you're right there on the corner. There's no other trailers or anything on the property. I have somebody pulling up that. That should be them. Let me check. Let me double check, though. Okay. Do you see any flashing lights, anything like that? Oh, do you see any flashing lights? Okay, do you see anything like reflecting off the house or anything? Okay?
They should announce themselves like when they're coming in. I should say you
pulling out, really, so they're pulling out like they're leaving. Can you alright? Can you see what's going on? Are you up? Are you walking? No, are you crawling? Okay, you're still in the same place you were. Okay. Is it like gravel on gravel. You could hear the gravel, the dirt, okay, and
you can hear any doors open or shut, or anything like that.
Are you hearing anything right now? Okay,
yeah, there's, there's lots of deputies coming your way, so I'm hoping it's one of them.
Do you hear a lot of movement outside, like
you can't see outside. Does
it sound like they're speeding? Yeah,
okay, we do have units there keep me on the line, okay, until there's someone with you. I'm sure it's that my dispatcher just told me that someone's there now, and they have border patrol with them. Okay? So they should be coming into the house, so they're going to announce, and more than likely, they're going to clear the property. So if they, if they you hear people coming in, let me know. Okay, can you please call my family now? Yeah, they're gonna, I probably put their name and number in the call. So that's gonna get done and they can't get in. I am trying to open it, the gate box. I don't know.
I don't know if they want they might have lost the gate, and they must make it harder to get in front of

you, Mister Chairman and members this bill, upon passage, will allow for a certification process for emergency dispatches. Currently, 31 other states have such a process. It will recognize a 208 hour doe approved course as a minimum standard. The goal of course is ensure that first responders are dispatched to emergency, catastrophic events with a higher level of quality and efficiency while minimizing human errors and mistakes. Our emergency dispatchers, by and large, do a great job, but by having every all 67 county people on the same doing the same thing, it will be helpful, and we have some. And I will shorten my introduction because we have some rather dramatic testimonies. The need for this legislation

Thank you so much for coming forward, firefighters and paramedics of Palm Beach County. Gary Rainey, Gary Rainey, thank you so much from Miami, Florida, the Florida professional firefighters. Lisa Henning. Lisa is with the Fraternal Order of Police right here in Tallahassee. She is a proponent of the bill Richard Goff, morning,

Richard, good morning. Welcome. Glad to have you here.

I'm a 25 year law enforcement veteran with the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office and the father of Denise Hamber Lee, she's my daughter was kidnapped, raped, murdered from her house in North court, where her two children were at home, or two year old and her six month old, my grandbabies, as a result, guy drove her down the road. She was able to get the attention of a bystander in a car at a traffic light by beating and screaming in the car.

Bystander called 911,

to my office, where I actually work, and to the dispatch, and they took the call. Lady gave the description of the car. The vehicle. Suspect described my daughter as being younger than what she was. All she could see is the hands. Could see is the hand slapping in the car and screaming like she's never heard screams. She even asked if there was an Amber Alert out on a person that day. As a result, our dispatch, my dispatch where I work, forgot to dispatch the call to road deputies out there, which we had over six agencies out there looking for my daughter that day, two helicopters, canine and approximately 30 people out there on the street looking for she was found later buried in a shallow grave shot in the head. We had cars on the road waiting to apprehend the guy right where she was at, but they never dispatched the car. On behalf of my daughter, I'd like to see this built. This bill passed, Richard Goff, and there's an internal investigation done found that the two girls were at fault. My boss gave one five days off and one three days off, so the family wasn't real happy with that either. So thank you,

Richard golf, thank you very much. Our heart truly goes out to you and your family. I am sorry you have to be here and testify and give that story that is a horrible story.

Amy Campbell,

pretty good. Amy is from Orlando, Florida, and she represents the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and she waves in support. Richard Penske, very good, Richard, you're from West Palm Beach, and you represent 911, emergency dispatchers. Thank you all for coming. Is there anyone else wishing to publicly testify on House Bill 997, members will go into into debate. Is there any debate? Yes, sir. Thank you very good. I'm sorry, Representative Hayes, you recognize in debate. Thank you, Mister Chairman.

Excuse me.

I am. Are deeply disturbed that this is only a voluntary certification. I'm sure representative domino has a reason for that, but I would like to see us look in the future at making it mandatory that the people who are answering these phone calls and are charged with dispatching units to respond, are properly trained and and have passed a certification test. I think this voluntary just doesn't go far enough. And share your sentiments toward the story of Sergeant Goff and his family, and there are many others that perhaps need our support as well, but I would certainly like for us to look in the future at making this a mandatory certification.

Representative Harrell in debate.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and my heart also goes out to Sergeant Goff on the loss of your daughter. I think that's an example of why training is so so important, especially in health care. Things not just law enforcement. Law enforcement is absolutely essential. They have that training. But I know running the health quality committee that when 911 is called More often than not, it's not a police issue, it's a health issue. And we need training for those dispatchers so that they understand how to handle that person who is often panicked, dealing with someone who is helping someone having a heart attack, having a baby or in an accident. So I think this is absolutely essential. And I will agree with Dr Hayes, I think that this is representative Hayes. I think this is needs to become the standard across the state and be required.

Representative Hudson, in debate.

Thank you, Chairman. Sergeant Gough, as a parent, I'm what just speechless at your testimony. It was powerful, and I can't imagine what you must be feeling. This is a great bill. I think the consistency of process is enormously important. We cannot have 67 different versions for 67 different counties of how we go about this process. Our first responders deserve better when they go out into the field, be it sheriff or firefighters or paramedics, to make sure that they're ensuring the public safety, and that consistency of process and good information in and good information out is going to save lives. And I support this bill.

Additional debate. Members, Representative Anderson in debate. Thank

you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to compliment representative domino for bringing this bill forward. It's a very important issue communication and getting the word out. And I also support the comment made by the other representative that maybe at some future time this should be a requirement. Thank you,

Representative Domino. You recognize the close

well, the members have closed perhaps better than I I might point out in 28 states, it is mandatory and some voluntary. You've got to start somewhere. I think for those of us that did watch the basketball game last night, you can do things under stress, make free throws that sometimes under stress. Under stress, you can't, and it's important, as the representative said, that you have a heads up in medical emergencies if the 911 dispatchers are all talking the same language and using the same protocol so the treatment can be better when you get there. So this is an important bill that will save lives and and very much help in emergency situations. I urge your support.

Very good and thank you very much. Represent domino for bringing this bill forward the
